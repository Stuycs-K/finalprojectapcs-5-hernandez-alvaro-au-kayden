### 2025-05-16
Completed the Proposal portion of the project. Worked in class with Alvaro to discuss some ideas and also find something that we were both interested in. 

About 20 - 30 minutes.

### 2025-05-19
Completed Part 1 of the Prototype in class. 

About 30 minutes.

### 2025-05-20
Completed Part 2 of the Prototype, the UML Diagram. Had to figure out what it consisted of so did some small research and found a website that had templates. 

About 30 minutes.

### 2025-05-27
Working on collisions. Friction works, but the logic for collisions doesn't checkout, need to work on that and research it more. Spent class time on it so about 40 minutes.

### 2025-05-28
Working on the starting position of the balls and the table class. Need to figure out the center to center distance of the diagonal balls as well as the center to center distance between adjacent balls. Need to find the true center for each ball and also the cue ball. About 30 or 40 minutes.

### 2025-05-29
Short working session to adjust stripes and solid balls and also the numbering of the balls. About 15 minutes.

Worked in class on ball positions, still need to redo the logic for the loop. Changes to the detection for bouncing but need to find out how to detect the hole. About 40 minutes.

Completed the intial ball positions, still need to move 8 ball to the center but other than that it works fine. About 30 minutes. 

### 2025-05-31
Long working session for fixing collisions, updating bounce detection, and updated the way that the game is displayed. Changed the loop for the display so that it updates the physics proponents 4 times per second, and then collisions once. Collisions work properly, I added the velocity vectors to the wrong balls, also added a new part for overlapping space between the balls. 

### 2025-06-01
Fixed collisions completely, reworked pockets and how they are detected by balls. Works completely.

About 30 minutes.

### 2025-06-02
Transferred all of the game setup code to the Table class, been adjusting the pocket radius through testing, changed gravity constant.

About 50 minutes.

### 2025-06-04 
Adding rules to the game, have cueball rule done, eight ball rule needs a little editing, other than that it works. 

About 40 minutes.
