# Project Description

Recreation of 8-Ball with following rules(many different variants of the game so these are the rules in our game):

- If the 8 Ball goes in on your turn you Lose.
- Hitting a ball of the opposite type FIRST or pocketing the CueBall leads to a Scratch.
- A scratched ball can be moved anywhere on the table.
- Can pocket the 8 Ball for the win once all the balls of your type have been pocketed.
- The first player to pocket a ball will take that ball's type.

Table dimensions exactly taken from Dimensions.com for a 9 foot table.

# Intended usage:

The CueStick will follow your mouse around and when you click it will strik the cue ball in that direction.

You can adjust the strength using the number keys: 1-6, and the space bar.

When the ball is scracthed you will see the text "Scratched" on the table and you can drag the ball to where you want.

Some keybinds to know, "q" resets the game, make sure everything stops moving before pressing it. "t" is for toggling on and off the tracer. 

The turn system will be shown on the right along with other controls.
